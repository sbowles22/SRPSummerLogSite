Hello! My name is Spencer and this is a simple Jekyll website I put together using a template from [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). The purpose of this website is to provide update about my current work for the summer of 2021. The overall goal of my work is to implement an algirthm to eltimate the LASSO for image reconstruction/signal processing applications on an FPAA and to compare said implementation to the state-of-the-art. I am doing this work under Dr. Jeff Young of The Georgia Institute of Technology under the CRNCH lab.
