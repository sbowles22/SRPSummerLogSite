title: Jul 22, 2021 - RASP Future Plans
---

After more difficulty with RASP and two meetings, we decide to shift our focus to Nengo implementations of LASSO.

### Rasp Difficulties

The summary of our troubles with RASP amounts to a few key problems:

* Requiring use of ubuntu 12.04 vm (Inflexible software tools)
* Lacking detailed error messaging (Hard to troubleshoot)
* Non-functioning email server (can't deploy to remote hardware by normal means)
* Lacking proper networking for our own FPAA (^)
* Unable to reach Dr. Hassler about issues (She seems too busy right now)

If we could solve a few of these problems, implementing LASSO should be possible. Because we only have about a month definitely left in the summer, we have decided to shelve the idea until we can solve one of said problems. 

### Nengo Implementation

We have decided to read a paper on someone who implemented a simple version of SLCA on RASP in the past. Using this, we should be able to implement the proper equations into Nengo.
