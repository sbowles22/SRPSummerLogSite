## SUMMARY OF WORK SINCE LAST ENTRY

Met with Dr. Young to discuss overall goals and was given tour of both the workspace and the server room houses our hardware (for neuromorphic around 10 PYNQ boards, some on nengo, and an FPAA that was away in Dr. Young's office at the time, but the lab has aronud 3 server racks, one with 4 shelves of 4 ARM processors at $10k each, so $160k for before networking and cooling and the extras) (included inside was also a new very expensive set GPUs [~$150k for 8] and a liquid cooled room of compacted small form factor GPUs for machine learning; all very high tech and expensive). Additionally, got ssh access to the former said machines (the PYNQ boards mainly, but I could also probably use the ARM processors if for some reason I needed to. Finally, I read some papers concerning using SNNs to accelerate the computation of compressed sensing radar through BPDN (the LASSO).	

## WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?	

space heaters can be very expensive :/

Also server rooms are organized into hot and cold aisles so the different air temperatures dont mix, and so HVACs can make sure to vent hot air from the server room and not cold air

## TANGIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS/RESULTS  (IF ANY)

None quite yet	

## PLANS FOR THE NEXT WEEK	

To read papers and formulate long-term plan for project

## GENERAL HAPPINESS (SCALE OF 1-10)	

8.5

## GENERAL CONFIDENCE (SCALE OF 1-10)

9
