title: Jul 7, 2021 - Telluride Conference
---

Long time no see! Since my last post, nothing too eventful happened; however, there is a lot of information from the Telluride conference that I have been attending.

#### Telluride

Telluride is a annual neuromorphic engineering conference typically held in its namesake town in Colorado. This year, however, the conference is being held on line. Our attendance at this conference was highly suggested by Dr. Young, and the sheer number of topics have been fascinating.  

In particular, we have been attending the keynote talks everyday and the afternoon sessions held mainly by Prof. Jennifer Hasler, the creator of the RASP tool chain, and Terry Stewart,  one of the creators of Nengo (so a very qualified group of teachers). These afternoon sessions have mostly encompassed in-depth tutorials of these tools, the methodology behind various features included, and insight into their creation.
