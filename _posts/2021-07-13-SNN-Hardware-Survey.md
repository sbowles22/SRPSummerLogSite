title: Jul 13, 2021 - SNN Hardware Implementation Survey
---

Today, I read a survey on SNN Hardware Implementations. This paper was fairly typical, but it notably gave a good explanation of coding, went over various mapping methods for NNs, gave a good explanation of the difficuly of training SNNs, and only 6 pages of about 30 were about hardware implementations.
