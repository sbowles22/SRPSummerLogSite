title: Jun 21, 2021 - NengoFPGA Chaotic Attractors
---

Today I had little tangible results, but I made progress to several necessary steps in the development process.

I started by getting x2go working on my offsite machine. While doing this, I ran into trouble having the proper proxy set up, but with some tweaking I was able to get a XFCE desktop on my vm without the need for a VPN as setting one up would likely take a while for the permissions to be set up properly. Afterwards, I set up a Jupyter notebook on said vm using x2go, which is made much easier by using a desktop.

To use this Jupyter network and continue to familiarize myself with nengo, particularly nengoFPGA, I tried setting up an example project that had to do with chaotic attractors. This example is based off [this paper](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/eliasmith.2005b.pdf), which I decided to read to better understand the project, and example code is provided in the nengoFPGA docs. I was unable to get this example working, however, because I did not have the proper permissions to download the necessary library. I will be double checking to make sure I don't need sudo access before progressing.

Finally, I am now an official affiliate of Georgia Tech! It took a while to get through HR, but soon I should be getting card access to working facilities. 

## What have I learned?

Chaotic attractors have been theorized to be at work in the neuronal networks behind smell recognition.

## Tangible accomplishments/results  (If any)

As the libraries are not working properly, no code, but the vm desktop window is satisfying to see.

## Plans for coming week

Get the chaotic attractor example working and running on an FPGA.
