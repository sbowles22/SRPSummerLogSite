title: Jun 17, 2021 - Long Term Plans
---

Firstly, I have read more papers on neuromorphic hardware, particularly the about Loihi chip from Intel. But most importantly, I met with Dr. Young again to discuss the long term goals of the project and to formulate techniques to reach the goals. 

The first and foremost goal of this project is to implement LASSO onto an FPAA and to evaluate the results against the state-of-the-art. The purposes of this are many, but largely include the benifit of enhancing the performance of image recunstruction and signal processing on low power devices, opening roads to applications in low power biomedical hardware, etc. A secondary goal of the project is to create an open source Python Jupyter notebook housing all of the code. The purpose of this mainly comes down to furthering the standardization of certain software tools for the development of neuromorphic systems/FPAAs. Currently, there are manifold software stacks, proprietary and open-source, for neuromorphic development, and scientists share little agreement on standards for the feild. The last objective, particularly of my graduate student, is to publish the findings in a journal/conference paper. 

As for meeting these goals, we have discussed various methods for keeping in touch as far as progress and roadblocks go. The system we will likely use is to send teams messages at the begginig of every day with a goal for that day and our progress. This is to make sure neither of us are stuck on a problems for too long during the development process.

## What have I learned?

Usage of power efficient computing techniques (such as analog neuromorphic) can lead to the development of devices with very low power consumptions. This is not just because the computing itsef is requireing lower power, but lower power sensing devices can be used, degrading input quality, but using more computation to pick up the slack. This can be seen in the image reconstruction of compressed sensing radar, where handheld, low power radar devices can exist because of an adaption of LASSO to power efficient hardware. 

## Tangible accomplishments/results  (If any)
